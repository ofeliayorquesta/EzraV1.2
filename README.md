# Ezra V1.2
Code for the live sound of Ezra V1.2

## Start TidalCycles

### PART 1. START TIDALCYCLES 

There might be occasions where you only want to use samples in tidal, and PART 2 may not be needed.

QUICK WAY is for when you have an urge to live code as plain as possible. 
STEREO is a fancier way of doing the quick way. Its just specifying things explicitly, rather than assuming your default settings. Might serve as an alternative code for debugging. 
MULTICHANNEL is for when you want to send separate signals to a DAW. 

### PART 2. CONFIGURE MIDI

-- SEND MIDI FROM TIDAL

When you want to play tidalcycles patterns using sounds from a DAW (or synth).

-- RECEIVE MIDI IN TIDAL

When you want to trigger patterns from a pedal (or midi controller).
